# FitHiCValidPeaksPipeline
A convenient pipeline utilizing fithic and its utils to take a directory with valid pairs file(s) and run FitHiC on them.
Note: The validPairs2FitHiC-fixedSize.sh util was updated as it was not functional for the pairs files the author of this script was using. You may need to alter this file for your purposes as well.
